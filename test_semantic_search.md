# Test Semantic Search Implementation

The semantic search tool has been successfully implemented with the following changes:

## Files Modified:

1. `/Users/jsk/Documents/zed/crates/assistant_tools/src/semantic_search_tool.rs` - Created new semantic search tool
2. `/Users/jsk/Documents/zed/crates/assistant_tools/src/assistant_tools.rs` - Registered the semantic search tool
3. `/Users/jsk/Documents/zed/crates/assistant_tools/Cargo.toml` - Added semantic_index dependency
4. `/Users/jsk/Documents/zed/crates/semantic_index/src/embedding_index.rs` - Removed unused import
5. `/Users/jsk/Documents/zed/crates/agent/src/context.rs` - Commented out pre-fetch semantic search

## Key Features:

- **On-demand search**: The semantic search is now triggered when the AI needs to find relevant documents, rather than pre-fetching during context loading
- **Proper tool integration**: Follows the Zed tool architecture with proper input/output schemas
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of cases where semantic indexing is not available
- **Rich output**: Provides both human-readable content and structured JSON output

## How it works:

1. When the AI needs to find relevant information, it can call the `semantic_search` tool
2. The tool takes a query string and optional limit parameter
3. It searches through the semantic index using the provided query
4. Returns structured results with file paths, excerpts, and line numbers
5. Formats the output for both AI consumption and user display

## Benefits:

- **Performance**: No longer pre-fetches potentially irrelevant search results
- **Efficiency**: Only searches when needed, reducing startup time
- **Flexibility**: AI can search for specific terms based on user questions
- **Scalability**: Better for large codebases with many indexed documents

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
