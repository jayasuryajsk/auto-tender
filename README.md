# Auto Tender

Auto Tender is a focused writing application based on the [Zed Editor](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed), which is copyright 2022-2025 Zed Industries, Inc. and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License.

## Overview

Auto Tender transforms the Zed code editor into a streamlined writing environment by removing developer-focused features and creating a cleaner, distraction-free interface optimized for writers.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Interface**: Removed technical elements like Git panel, themes, and extension managers
- **Writing-Focused Settings**: Easily accessible options for spell checking, word count, and other writing tools
- **Distraction-Free**: Clean UI designed for writing content rather than coding
- **Multi-instance Support**: Run multiple instances of Auto Tender simultaneously

## How It Differs from Zed

Auto Tender keeps the powerful core of Zed but:
- Places settings directly in the main interface
- Disables developer tools by default
- Focuses the UI on writing-related features
- Simplifies menus and options

## Getting Started

To build Auto Tender from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayasuryajsk/auto-tender.git
cd auto-tender
cargo build --release
```
